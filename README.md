## Deploying the Build of the vue app

In the branch [deploy_the_build](https://github.com/ashique12009/express-vue-mongodb-blog), the production version of the Vue app has been created, and copied/served under the Express server:

 * `npm run build` on the client was used to create the `build` folder (after this, the `client` directory)
 * `server.js` may now run on port 8000, as the _main_ (and only) running server.

 You only need to start the server (`cd server; nodemon server.js`).
